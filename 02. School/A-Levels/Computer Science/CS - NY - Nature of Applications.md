# Categories of Software
- Software can be grouped into several categories
	- Systems Software - (*Manages Hardware and Provides a Platform for Applications*) & Applications Software (*Designed for End Users to perform Specific Tasks*)
	- Systems Software: Operating Systems, Utility Programs, Library Programs, Translators
	- Applications Software: Off-the-Shelf, Custom Written, Proprietary (Closed Source), Open Source
# Systems Software

## Utility Programs
- Optimise the performance of the computer and perform useful background tasks
- These are programs such as:
	- Disk Defragmenter
	- Automatic Backup
	- Compression Software
	
### Disk Defragmenter
- Large files stored on a magnetic hard drive may be split up across several physical disk locations
- A Defragmenter reorganises the hard drive so that files are in *sequential* blocks where possible
- The result is that files can be read more quickly
- The defragmenter will try to ensure all parts of file A are contiguous by moving other files if necessary

### Automatic Backup
- Data in permanent storage needs to be regularly backed up
- Users may forget to do this so the process can be automated, specifying:
	- Where - portable hard drive, cloud, local server
	- When - usually when the computer is not in use
	- What - which data should be backed up
	- How - should backups be compressed

### Automatic Updates
- Runs in the background detecting software update releases and automatically installing them
- Some updates add new software features
- Some important updates fix security issues which could be otherwise exploited by hackers

### Virus Checker
- Scans permanent storage for viruses by comparing files to known virus definitions
- May also scan files 'on access' as they are opened
- Must be kept up to date with new virus definitions to be effective
- Antivirus software uses **heuristics** - knows what types of behaviour are likely to be used by a malicious program
	- Heuristics can be used to guess which programs or files may contain a virus, based on their behaviour
- Sometimes the virus checker will flag a harmless file as a virus - **false positive**
### Compression Software
-  We may want to send large files across the internet
- Compression software reduces the size of files
	- Some files can be significantly reduced and other cannot
### Libraries and Translators
- Allow programs to use pre-written routines and to be translated into executable code
# Applications Software
- Software that performs a task to benefit the user
- Can be divided into the categories:
	- General Purpose, Special Purpose, Bespoke
## Off-the-Shelf or Bespoke?
- *Ready-made* software available to anyone is known as **off-the-shelf** software
- Software that is *custom-made* for a specific user is known as **bespoke**
## Open-Source Software
- Open-source software allows anyone to access its source code
- The software is open-source *licensed* but free to use
- Anyone may modify the software and also sell it, on the condition that the software produced is also open-source
- Different from *freeware* - software that is free for anyone to use but source code is not available
## Closed Source Software (Proprietary)
- Closed-source software does not allow access to source code
- Users must pay the person or company who owns the copyright license to use the software
- There may be restrictions on how the software can be used
# Selecting an Application
- The criteria used when selecting what kind of software to use:
	- Functionality - does it do what I want it to do?
	- Hardware - will it run on the hardware and the OS?
	- Availability - already exists or specially written?
	- Cost - how much is it ?
	- Reliability - are there bugs, has it been tested?

# Key Notes/Plenary
- **Systems Software** is necessary for the system to operate
- **Applications Software** performs tasks for the user
- **Utility Programs** ensure the system runs smoothly
- **Open-Source** software allows free access to the software and its source code
- **Closed-Source** software requires users to pay for a licence and source code is hidden
