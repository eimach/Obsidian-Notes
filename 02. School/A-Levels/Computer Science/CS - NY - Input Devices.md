> The emphasis in this course is on describing how different I/O devices can be applied as a solution to different problems
## Manual Input Devices
- All input devices transfer *data* from the *source* in the outside world to the *computer*
- Some input devices require greater human intervention than scanners or cameras to generate data such as:
	- Keyboards & Keypads
	- Pointing Devices - Mouse or Trackball
	- Microphones
	- Touch Screens - Tablets, Smart Watches, Mobile Phones
	- Interactive Whiteboards - Used to show audiences at meetings or classroom students a computer's output, Allows users to use the board as a touchscreen or write over the screen to annotate.
## Barcode Readers
- Two common types of barcode systems:
	- **Universal Product Code version 'A'** (*UPC-A*) - Used in retail and warehousing. Can *only* represent numeric digits
	- **Code 128** - Used in transport and shipment tracking. Can represent numbers *and* letters
## QR Codes
- QR Codes are 2D Barcodes and can be read by smartphones or tablets
- They can contain: Information or Links to Websites
- Common Uses:
	- Restaurant Coupons
	- Mobile Concert Tickets
	- Real Estate Agency Boards
	- Business Cards
	- Tourist Information
	- Advertising Posters
## 2D Scanners
- These are used to convert a paper document or photograph into a computer-readable format
- Useful for emailing hand-drawn images or text to someone else
## 3D Face Recognition
- Security camera may use face recognition
- Specialist software measures and compares the proportions of a person's face with those stored![[Pasted image 20250124101225.png]]
## 3D Scanners
- 3D Scanners are used both in the industrial and medical fields
- Many 3D scanners rely on a technology called ***Tomography*** - which basically means to image something in very thin slices (less than 0.1mm thick)
- e.g. MRIs
## Sensors
- **Definition** - ‘*A hardware device that can take measurement of physical properties, such as temperature or pressure, from real world surroundings. These measurements are usually a representation of the actual property being measured.*’
- Some data can be obtained directly through the use of sensors
- Sensors often collect data in an analogue form and require conversion to digital data to be processed
- Sensors are used in both monitoring and control application
### Analogue Measurements
- Analogue means that data has *no discrete value* and the data changes smoothly rather than in exact jumps
- e.g.
	- Thermometers where temperature is measured by the height of the mercury
	- Speedometers showing speed represented by a needle on a gauge
	- Seismometer recording force and duration of ground movement by visualising the motion of a weight on a string using a pen
### Types of Sensors
- Many types of sensors are designed to carry out specific tasks such as:
	- Gas - e.g. Oxygen, Carbon Dioxide
	- Infrared - e.g. Motion, Heat Source
	- Light
	- Temperature
	- Pressure
	- pH - Acid or Alkalinity
	- Magnetic Field
	- Acoustics
## Monitoring & Control
- Monitoring:
	- With these applications, the computer or microprocessor will make no changes to the actual process; it will *simply report the values*
- Control:
	- The output from the computer or microprocessor can alter how the process is operating
	- It can change the value of the next input received by, *for example, opening a valve, switching off a heater or changing the speed of a pump*
	- The output from the computer or microprocessor can affect the next input it receives
## Detection Systems
- The *pressure sensors* monitor an intruder stepping on the floor next to the windows, doors or on the floor next to valuable painting
- The *acoustic sensors* pick up the sound of breaking glass or footsteps on the floor
- The *infra-red sensors* pick up movement in the rooms but also any changes in heat (e.g. heat radiation from an intruder)
## Sensor Feedback
- Sensors constantly take readings for monitoring
	- If any of the sensor readings exceed pre-set values, the microprocessor then sends a signal to warn the user -- screen output, siren or flashing lights
	- Each sensor will feed into an interface box that the microprocessor can pin-point exactly which sensor sent the high value
	- Monitoring continues until the user keys in a *PIN or Passcode* to deactivate the system
