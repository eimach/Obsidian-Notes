## What is Abstraction?
Abstraction is the process of removing unnecessary detail to create a representation of reality.
## Why is Abstraction Used?
Abstraction is used as it removes unnecessary complexity & saves time and resources.
## How much Abstraction Should Be Used?
There is a <u>limit</u> to how much abstraction should be used as:
- Too much = Too simple
- Too little = Too complicated and uses too many resources
Ultimately, it depends on how close to reality your program needs to be and what the type of problem you are trying to solve.

# Practice Questions
1) <u>(4 Marker)</u>
	Abstraction is the act of removing unnecessary detail to create a representation of reality. For example, in Fig.1, the map removes the names of all the small non-major roads and towns/areas and only keeps the names of important landmark cities and regions.

2) <u>(3 Marker)</u>
	In the creation of the flight simulator, abstraction is needed to remove unnecessary complexity and to save time and resources. In the case of a flight simulator, abstraction removes the complexity of maintaining and repairing an aeroplane and saves time, money and labour that would be spent on fuelling, repairing and maintaining the aeroplane and all its systems and mechanics.
