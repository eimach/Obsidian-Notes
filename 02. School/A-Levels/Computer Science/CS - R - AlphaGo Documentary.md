> British Company, DeepMind [a Subsidiary of Google], creating an AI program (AlphaGo) to play the board game, Go.

# Notes
- Difficult to create as Go requires human intuition and has many more possible board configuration than Chess [200:20].
- First time a Professional Human Go Player was beaten by a program.
- Program was completed "A Decade Earlier than Expected".
- AlphaGo was created using a Deep Neural Network.
- First Human that AlphaGo played against was 2 Dan Go Player, Fan Hui, who was later brought on as an advisor for DeepMind during their preparation for the match against, Professional 9 Dan Player, Lee Se-dol.
- An AI beating a human is the "Ultimate Show of Human Ingenuity and Cleverness" and a show of "Human Endeavour".
