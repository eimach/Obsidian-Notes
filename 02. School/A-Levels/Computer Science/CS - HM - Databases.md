# What is a Database?
- A database is an organised collection of data
- There are two types of Databases: Flat-File and Relational
## Flat-File Database
- All of the data is stored in one table
- Rows are Records, Columns are Fields![[Pasted image 20250401093616.png]]
- The benefits to a **Flat-File Database** are:
	- Quick to set up and easy to maintain
	- Require little expertise -> No need for fancy software
- However, the drawbacks are:
	- Leads to data redundancy
	- Takes up unnecessary *storage*
	- Slower to query as it grows
	- Harder to maintain and update as it grows

## Relational Database
- The data is stored in multiple tables that are linked together using *foreign keys*![[Pasted image 20250401102128.png]]
- *Primary Keys* and *Foreign Keys* are used in **Relational Databases**:
	- The Primary Key is the *unique identifier* - Always in the First Field
	- The foreign key is when the primary key of another table is used as an *attribute* to link tables/represent a relationship ![[Pasted image 20250401102410.png]]
