# Notes
## Output Devices
- Output devices take data produced by a computer and turn it into a human-readable form(Printed Document or Image on a Screen)
	- Most common are printers, screens, loudspeakers and multimedia projectors
## Printers
### Inkjet Printers
- Are the most common form of printer
- Range from small inexpensive models to models used for professional photo printing
### Operating Costs
- Inkjets are often sold at or below production cost whilst the price of ink cartridges is *dramatically* marked up
	- Many inkjets will not a print a B&W page if a colour cartridge runs out
	- Cheaper water-soluble ink tends to smear or blur with a small drop of moisture
### Laser Printers
- Use dry, powdered ink called *toner*
	- Available in colour or monochrome
- Businesses almost exclusively use laser printers due to their speed and reliability
- Have excellent print quality
	- Common uses are: Printing Company Stationary, Making Labels, Creating Brochures and Fliers
### Dot Matrix Printers
- Sometimes known as **Impact Printers**
- Similar to typewriters as they strike an inked ribbon which imprints dots to form letters on the page
	- Useful where multi-part stationary is required
	- Can work effectively in damp or dirty atmospheres
	- Noisy, Poor print quality, expensive to buy
### 3D Printers
- Can print using plastic filament, powdered resin, ceramic or metal powder, or paper
- Produce solid objects that actually work
- Medicine Applications are:
	- Manufacturing Prosthetic Limbs or Orthotics
	- Reconstructive Surgery or General Surgery
- Application in Manufacturing and Art:
	- Printing parts for cars that are no longer manufactured and at a fraction of the cost
	- Prototyping for design, fashion and art can save huge costs
## RFID
- Stands for *Radio Frequency ID*
- Are Input/Output devices
- Use a *Transponder* and a *Receiver*
	- Receiver emits Radio Frequency Energy
	- Transponder antenna becomes energised by the radio waves
	- Transponder can then send data to the Receiver
### Uses of RFID Tags
- Security control points or identification of people, animals, goods or valuable
- Shipping and supply chain tracking for goods
- Banking and Fast-Payment Systems
- Potential Replacement for Barcode System
### Passive and Active Tags
- **Passive** transponders, *e.g. used in bank cards*, have no independent power source and rely on radio waves from the receiver for energy
- **Active** tags use a larger, battery powered beacon which can broadcast its own signal to receivers up to 300m away 
	- Useful for larger items that are not placed on a receiver by hand, e.g. toll stations, warehousing, control points
## Actuators
- Are motors that are commonly used in conjunction with sensors to control a mechanism
- e.g. Opening a Valve or Door, Moving an Aircraft's Control Surface, Turning a Wheel or Fan
## Loudspeakers and Headphones
- Digital Data is sent from the computer to a DAC (*Digital Audio Converter*) where it is then converted to an analogue signal.
- The analogue signal is then amplified using and sent to a speaker
## LCD Monitors
- LCD stands for *Liquid Crystal Display*
- LCD Screens contain groups of red, green and blue diodes to form each pixel
	- Monitor screens require backlighting using either **Cold Cathode Fluorescent Lamps** (CCFL) or LEDs since the crystals act as a light valve and do not emit light themselves
### LEDs vs. CCFLs
- LEDs to backlight LCD screens have a number of advantages over the older CCFLs:
	- Maximum Brightness is reached almost immediately
	- Sharper Image with more Realistic and Vivid Covers
	- Better Picture Definition as a Brighter Light is produced
	- Thinner Screens as LEDs are quite small
	- More reliable screens as they last almost indefinitely
	- Consume very little power and produce little heat and reduce running costs
## OLED Screens
- OLED stands for *Organic LED*
- OLED screens are much thinner and lighter than traditional LCD or LED screens
- Plastic, rather than glass makes them flexible
- OLED systems emit much brighter lights than LCD or LED
### Benefits of OLED
- OLEDs generate their own light so there is no need for backlighting -> Reduces Complexity
- Consume less power -> Good for battery operated devices
- Produce a little amount of heat -> Reduces Fire Risk
- Have a larger Field of View than LCD Screens -> Further enhanced on curved screens
## Multimedia Light Projectors
- Compact, High-Resolution, Full-Colour Projectors
- Can project text, images, video and audio content
### How They Work
- Projector takes a video signal, converts it into a viewable image and then projects it on a screen.
	- Can be used to present PowerPoints, TV, DVDs and Video Games
