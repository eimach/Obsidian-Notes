## Hierarchy Charts:
- Each box in a hierarchy chart should start with a verb and contain one idea/instruction.
- Each row should represent the entire problem

## What is Decomposition?
- Decomposition is the process of splitting a problem into sub-problems and splitting them further until each smaller sub-problem can easily be solved
### Benefits of Decomposition:
- Speed & Efficiency  
- Can easily work out what functions to write  
- Can easily identify reusable components & avoid duplication  
- Can effectively split up code amongst team
