## Types of Memory
- The two main types are:
	- **RAM** (*Random Access Memory*)
	- **ROM** (*Read Only Memory*)

|                                       |                       RAM                       |                    ROM                    |
|:-------------------------------------:|:-----------------------------------------------:|:-----------------------------------------:|
|          What does it store?          | OS, Running Programs, Data currently being used | Computing Bootup Instructions (Bootstrap) |
| What happens to data when turned off? |            Lost as it is *Volatile*             |     Retained as it is *Non-Volatile*      |
|            Read or Write?             |                 Read *&* Write                  |                Read *Only*                |
### RAM
- Can be *read* from and *written* to.
- Access to RAM is very fast
- At any one time, it will normally contain:
	- Operating System
	- Software Currently in Use
	- Data which the Software is using
- When your computer is turned on, the computer stores running programs and data in RAM.
- When the computer is off, RAM is empty but all programs and data are safe on the hard disk
- When you switch on your computer, the start-up instructions load the operating system from your hard disk into RAM
- When programs are loaded, they are copied into RAM from *secondary storage* (e.g. hard disk). RAM starts to fill up
- When you open a software which needs more memory than there is available in RAM, Virtual memory is used (from a HDD or SSD) as an extension to RAM.
	- Is much slower than RAM
## Primary & Secondary Storage
- Primary Storage is *volatile* and usually refers to RAM
- Secondary Storage refers to *non-volatile* storage such as:
	- Magnetic Storage (HDD)
	- Optical Storage (CD-ROM)
	- Solid State Devices (SSDs, using Flash Memory)
- Secondary Storages #dolater
## Inside A Hard Drive
### Tracks, Sectors & Platters
- Concentric tracks are created on a magnetic disk
- Disk spins at high speeds: 3,600 - 7,200 rpm
- Spinning platters are each read by drive heads

### Company Server Data
- Hard Disks have very high capacity, fast read/write speeds and are relatively cheap, storage per TB
## Cloud Storage
- Files are not stored locally on a computing device but are stored on remote servers.
	- Stored on physical storage media (HDD, SSD) grouped in huge data storage warehouses, have increasing high capacity
- Advantages are the ability to access files stored on the cloud from any device with an internet connection, Allows you to easily contribute with others and Files no longer take up any space on your own device
- Disadvantages are that you must have an internet connection to access files and can be costly, with a monthly/annual subscription cost
## Solid State Drives
- Commonly use electrically programmable *non-volatile* **flash memory**
- Advantages:
	- More Durable -> No Moving Parts
	- Faster than HDD
	- Consume Less Power
	- More Portable
- Disadvantages:
	- Typically Less Capacity than HDD
	- More Expensive than HDD
## USB Flash Drives
- Can store up to 128GB of Data
- Prices start at >Â£5.00
- Can use password protection
- Useful for transferring data between computers
## CDs, DVDs & Blu-Ray
- The capacities of the discs are different despite all having the same physical size is due to *different laser wavelengths which 'burn' smaller pits* and *the spiral track can therefore be more tightly wound, creating a longer track*.

### Optical Disk Formats
- Optical Disks are available as:
	- Read Only
	- Recordable
	- Re-Writable Formats
### Software Mailing
- Best suited to optical disks
- Cheap to manufacture and distribute
- Robust during carriage
- Lightweight
### CD Formats
- CDs come in 3 different formats:
	- CD-ROM (Read Only) -> "Pressed" at the time of manufacture
	- CD-R (Recordable) -> Can be written to once
	- CD-RW (Rewritable) -> Can be written and read many times, erased and written again
### Optical Disks Uses
- CD-ROM is widely used for software distribution
- CD-R may be used for copying a game, software, audio, video files or documents which can then easily be stored offline
- CD-RW is useful for short or medium-term backup, or transferring files from one computer to another
- DVD & Blu-Ray are high-capacity discs which can store feature-length films
## Capacity & Access Speed of Drives

| Media            | Capacity    | Access Speed |
| ---------------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| Hard Disk        | 512GB - 6TB | Fast         |
| CD-ROM           | 700MB       | Medium       |
| DVD              | 4.7 - 8.5GB | Medium       |
| Blu-Ray Disk     | 25-50GB     | Medium       |
| Solid-State Disk | 4GB - 2TB   | Very Fast    |
