## Preconditions
- A Precondition is a condition that must always be *True or False* for our given problem.
- We have to consider any tools, skills, strengths or weaknesses before pursuing a project solution
### Simple Rules for Preconditions:
- Be Specific & Explicit
- Preconditions must always evaluate to *True* or *False*
	- e.g. ~~Tony can't be late~~ -> Tony must be home before 6 pm
	- e.g. ~~No money~~ -> Tony can't use money
#### Example of Redesigning a Room:
**Preconditions**:
- Furniture must fit through door
- Furniture must not block door once inside room
- Furniture must fit within dimension of the room
**Inputs**:
- Type of Furniture
- Cost of Furniture
- Dimensions of Room
**Output**:
- <span style="background:#40a9ff">New Room</span>

## Reusability
- ==**For reusable code in python, use functions.**==
### Why Use Reusable Components when Solving Problems?
- <u>Saves time</u> as you don’t need to recreate them, can use in future
- Can import them and use them in many places. So when we want to make changes to the reusable component, we only need to make that change once.
- Code will be shorter as we are avoiding <u>duplication</u>.
- The reusable components would have been tested and would be reliable which increases code’s reliability
- If working in a group, it can be easier to split problems into different functions so each person is working on individual functions.
- In Exam Questions, don’t forget to <u>contextualise</u>.
