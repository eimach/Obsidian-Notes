# Ideas
## Structure
Typical J-Rock and Rock inspiration for structure so go with a [Intro; Verse; Chorus; Verse; Chorus] Structure or a [Intro; Chorus; Verse] Structure. Use Arpeggios in down sections and rhythmic strumming in upbeat sections
## Harmony/Chord Progressions
Initial Idea is a [Fmaj7 - A7 - C#m7 - G7 - A7 - B7 ]
	Works but according to ChatGPT, it wouldn't fully fit into the given bassline and also lacks a specific key in its current -> apparently "highly chromatic and modulating". Suggests A major, E major or Dm for key I do agree with the fact that it doesn't fit with bassline fully. The bassline is a bit odd and weird to harmonise -> implies something like a [Em - Dm or Bdim - Em7 - C???] -> suggests being in Em according to ChatGPT and the Brief
ChatGPT Idea *to work with bassline* is [Em7 - A7 - C#(halfdim)7 - Gmaj7 - A7 - B7]
Why? - Fmaj7 too distant from Em, C#m7 sounds too major; A half-dim sounds better (x4545x or 9x998x) and fits into E Harmonic Minor, G7 is unusual in Em so Gmaj7 keeps the vibe but makes more sense (3x443x) and A7-B7 is a jazzy turnaround that fits Em and A *and* the B7 resolves nicely to Em
Palm Mute Power Chords and Funky*ish* strumming for Rhythm Playing. Have piano (if included) follow the bassline or the guitar, not sure
## Melodies
Want to use octaves in the Lead Parts over the Rhythm Guitar, Minor Pentatonic works well for solo and melody lines.
## Drums
Keep it simple and use a basic drum pattern. 4-to-the-Floor Kick, Snare on 2 & 4, Extra syncopated kicks, 8th and 16th note hi-hats, incorporate Open Hats and Crashes. Use crashes and rides for different sections, Learn to write drum fills with Snare and Toms, Hi-Hat Rolls
Take Wasurete Yaranai and Sakayume as Ideas
