## Structure
Knowledge, Application, Analysis, Evaluation
- Knowledge - Define key terms (What is *Cyclical*, *Structural*, *Classical*, *Frictional*, *Seasonal* Unemployment? & Draw a Cyclical Unemployment Diagram)
- Application - Apply concepts (Cyclical Unemployment) to Real World (i.e. Extracts)
- Analysis - Explain relationships between things and impacts of whatever the topic is
- Evaluation - Provide  counterpoints to arguments and question validity of arguments
## Answer
Cyclical Unemployment is Unemployment due to a fall in a component of Aggregate Demand and as labour is a derived demand, when AD falls, employment also falls.
One way in which Cyclical Unemployment is the most damaging type of unemployment is that it is witnessed across multiple industries simultaneously. This is due to cyclical unemployment commonly taking place during recessions or economic downturns where Aggregate Demand is lowered and leads to widespread job losses as firms cut employees to lose less revenue to wages. This, in turn causes *Consumption* to also decrease as households have less income and *disposable income* to purchase goods and services which is a negative multiplier effect. This also causes G to have to increase in order to provide JSA and unemployment benefits to workers during this period of time. However, although cyclical unemployment is harmful due to losses of jobs across many industries, cyclical unemployment typically is short-lived as it mostly decreases once the recession passes, during the economic upturn and boom, unlike other types such as Structural Employment which is typically longer lasting.
One way in which Cyclical Unemployment is *not* the most damaging type of unemployment is that Cyclical unemployment is typically shorter than other types of unemployment such as *Structural Unemployment*. Structural Unemployment is a form of unemployment that takes place due to changes in the economy which causes certain industries and markets to have less demand for labour, such as mining. This form of unemployment tends to leave people in certain regions and sectors out of work for a much longer time compared to cyclical unemployment as structural unemployment comes with the possibility of leaving people occupationally immobile as they find it difficult to reskill from, for example, a car manufacturer to a service-based role.
