## <u>Income Elasticity of Demand / YED:</u>
- Definition: YED measures how much <span style="background:#fdbfff">quantity demanded</span> will respond to a <span style="background:#d2cbff">change in income</span>.
	- Income is represented using Y.
	- There are **two** types of goods related to income.

### Normal Goods:
- If Income (Y) increases, Quantity Demanded also *increases*.
- If Income (Y) decreases, Quantity Demanded also *decreases*.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Therefore, Normal Goods have a Positive YED (Positive Relationship between QD and Y.)</span>
### Inferior Goods:
- If Income (Y) increases, Quantity Demanded *decreases*.
- If Income (Y) decreases, Quantity Demanded *increases*.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Therefore, Inferior Goods have a Negative YED (Inverse Relationship between QD and Y.)</span>
## <u>Equation for YED:</u>
$$
YED = \frac{\Delta \% \ QD}{\Delta \% \ Y}
$$
$$
YED = \frac{Percentage \  Change \ in \ Quantity \ Demanded}{Percentage \ Change \ in \ Income}
$$

## <u>Income Elasticity:</u>
### Normal Goods
- Normal Goods have a Positive YED
- When YED is between 0 and 1, a good is Income Inelastic
	- Income Elastic Goods tend to be necessities
### Luxury Goods
- When YED > 1, a good is Income Elastic
	- Income Elastic Goods tend to be luxury goods.
### Inferior Goods
- YED is **always** negative for inferior goods.
