Question 1:
	The amount of land used for organic farming in the UK in recent years has decreased. The graph shows that in 2010, ~675,000 hectares were used for organic farming but in 2013, only ~550,000 hectares were used for organic farming.

Question 3:
	Supply of UK-produced organic meat and dairy products falling, prices should rise.
	The rationing function will affect allocation of resources as due to the scarcity of the products, those who are willing and able to pay the higher prices will be allocated the products whilst those who aren't will not be allocated product.

Question 4:
	%% Increased imports of organic produce will lead to a fall in the price of organic produce in UK shops. %%
	Increased imports of organic produce may lead to a fall in price of organic produce in UK shops as the imported produce could cost more than UK produced produce which would incentivise buyers to purchase UK produce instead of imported produce due to the incentive function of Price Mechanism.
