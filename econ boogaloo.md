Q1) A fall in the price of sugar means that it becomes cheaper for Coca-Cola to produce its drinks as sugar is a key input in production so this lowers production costs. This would cause the supply curve for Coca-Cola to shift to the right. As a result, the price of Coca-Cola could fall, and the quantity sold would increase.
This may lead to more demand, especially if Coca-Cola becomes cheaper than its competitors. However, the impact depends on whether the firm passes on the cost savings to consumers with lower prices or keep prices the same and keep their profit.
In the long term, this could make Coca-Cola more competitive. But if other costs like labour or transport are still high, the overall effect might be smaller. Also, consumer preferences or health concerns about sugary drinks could limit the increase in demand.

Q2) The price elasticity of supply (PES) measures how much supply responds to a change in price. If PES is elastic, producers can increase output quickly when prices rise.

Sugar supply is likely to be Price Elastic because it takes time to grow sugar crops and farmers can’t instantly increase output. Also, land and weather conditions limit how much more sugar can be produced. This means supply doesn’t respond quickly to price changes.
However, in the long run, supply may become more elastic. For example, if farmers get a higher price, they might plant more sugar cane in the next season. Also, if subsidies are given, producers may invest in better technology or expand farms.
So overall, sugar has inelastic supply in the short run, but could become more elastic over time.

Q3) Subsidies are government loans give to companies to stimulate production and lower cost of production. In this scenario, firms are likely to produce more sugar. The supply curve will shift to the right, leading to a lower market price and a higher quantity sold. This benefits consumers through cheaper prices and may increase producer incomes.
In the UK, more sugar might be produced, helping domestic farmers. This could reduce reliance on imports and improve food security. However, the UK might still not be able to compete with large producers like India.
In India, subsidies may help large-scale production grow even more. This could lead to falling world prices if India exports more sugar. While this helps consumers globally, it might harm producers in other countries who can’t compete with the subsidised prices.
A potential downside is that subsidies are expensive for governments. This money could be used elsewhere. Also, encouraging sugar production may conflict with health goals, since sugar is linked to health problems.
In conclusion, while subsidies may boost output and lower prices, they have opportunity costs and can distort global markets.

Q4) The UK housing market faces major problems. House prices are high, making it hard for young people to buy homes. Renters face high costs and limited supply. In some areas, rent takes up more than half of people’s income.
One policy is to increase housing supply by building more homes. This would shift the supply curve to the right, making houses more affordable. The government could use subsidies, tax cuts for developers, or make planning laws more flexible. However, this takes time and may face local opposition.
Another option is rent controls, which limit how much landlords can charge. This helps renters in the short run. But it might reduce incentives for landlords to maintain or rent out properties, which could cause a shortage of quality housing.
Affordable housing schemes, like shared ownership or Help to Buy, aim to help first-time buyers. These schemes increase demand, but if supply doesn't increase too, they could push prices even higher.
A land value tax could also be used to encourage landowners to develop unused land. This might help tackle the problem of land hoarding and free up space for new builds.
In conclusion, solving the housing crisis requires a mix of policies. Increasing supply is the most effective in the long term, but support for renters and first-time buyers is also needed. The government must balance these carefully to avoid worsening the problem.

Q1) Monetary policy uses interest rates and quantitative easing by manipulating base rates and controlling the money supply in the economy to control inflation and support economics growth. After the financial crisis and during COVID-19, interest rates were kept low to boost spending and investment. The Bank of England also used Q.E to increase money supply. This helped prevent a deeper recession and supported jobs. However, keeping rates low for too long may have increased inequality. More recently, the Bank raised interest rates to fight inflation caused by energy prices and supply chain issues. Higher rates help reduce inflation by lowering demand as they raise the base which in turn raises the market rate, making the cost of borrowing more expensive so investors and consumers are disincentivised from borrowing so AD falls. But they also raise mortgage costs, which affects consumers and can reduce growth. Overall, monetary policy has helped support the economy in difficult times, but it has limits. It can't fix supply-side problems or global shocks. In recent years, it was partly effective, but had some negative side effects too.

Q2) Living standards depend on things like income, inflation, access to services, and overall well-being. In recent years, UK real wages have been squeezed by high inflation. Many households face rising energy bills and rent, reducing disposable income. However, there are some positive signs. If inflation continues to fall and wages rise faster, real incomes could improve. Government policies to raise the minimum wage and increase benefits might help low income households. Growth in technology and investment in green energy might create new jobs and raise productivity. But there are risks. Brexit has caused trade frictions. The NHS and public services are under pressure, which affects quality of life. Also, regional inequality means some parts of the UK may do better than others. London and the South East often recover faster, while other regions lag behind. In conclusion, some factors point to rising living standards, but many challenges remain. It depends on how well the government manages the economy and whether wage growth stays ahead of inflation.
