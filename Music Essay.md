# Answer
**Do you agree that pop music must always be simple in order to make a big impact?**

In Pop Music, simplicity of a track can be determined by multitude of things such as the virtuosity displayed on instruments, the harmonic complexity or the layering, texture and instrumentation used. In response to the question, I don't fully agree with the question as pop music does not *need* to be simple to make a big impact on the audience and listeners.

For example, Sir Duke by Stevie Wonder creates a big impact on listeners despite not being simple as it features many layers that work on each other and relatively complex harmony. The chord progression in Sir Duke features a common, jazzy movement of I-vi-IV-V which is seen in the verses. The pre-chorus section then uses a jazz-inspired chromatic progression with a walkdown from E9 to C#9 and back to E9. This creates a bit of tension and interest due to the use of chromaticism which then has a feeling of resolution once the chorus progression begins which features a slight modification of the verse progression (I-#iv-IV-ii-V-I). This progression once again is very jazz influenced as the final 3 chords (ii-V-I) is a standard jazz clich√© and turnaround. There is also a heavy use of extended chords, such as the 9th chords in the Pre-Chorus' chromatic walk and the Emaj9 in the Chorus, and creates harmonic interest and can invoke an emotional impact upon the listener. The tonality of Sir Duke is B Major which creates the whole uplifting, jubilant affekt throughout the whole song. The structure of Sir Duke follows a typical pop structure of Intro-Verse-Pre Chorus- Chorus-Verse but with an addition of a shout chorus/horn solo after the chorus sections. This shout chorus section features rising triads in the horns which creates the uplifting impact and makes the section enjoyable and feel-good like. These details of Sir Duke show that pop music can be complex and intricate yet still create a big impact on listeners.

Another song is Superstition by Stevie Wonder which creates an impact on listeners of being incredibly catchy and memorable. One aspect that creates this is the repetitive hook melody which plays through majority of the song as it features syncopation and a groove which is the main focus compared to the pitch and notes played. The harmony used in the song is relatively simple as it is based on the Ebm chord and various extensions which creates a funky feel and makes it memorable due to it being the same chord repeated. The tonality of Superstition is in the Eb Dorian Mode which creates a soulful and uplifting affekt. The instrumentation of Superstition plays a key role in the catchiness of the song is the Hohner Clavinet that plays the hook and has a very bright and punchy bite timbre to it which increases its prominence. While Superstition is rhythmically complex, the catchy clavinet riff has created an impact of being memorable and recognisable even decades later.

Big Yellow Taxi by Joni Mitchell creates a different impact to Superstition and Sir Duke and in a different way. Compared to the Stevie Wonder examples, Joni Mitchell's music is a lot simpler. For example, the instrumentation is vocals and an acoustic guitar which places the primary focus of the song to the lyrics and Mitchell's voice rather than the harmony from the accompanying guitar. The tonality is in E Major which creates a sunny, uplifting affekt. The harmony is simple as it is diatonic which doesn't attract the listener's attention away from her vocals. The melody comes from Mitchell's vocal lyrics which are discussing the environment but are very folk-sounding and simple with a playful articulation and delivery. This song has produced an impact of memorability but also some listener's may connect with the lyrics and Mitchell's views on the environment.

In conclusion, Superstition and Sir Duke show that complexity can create impactful pop music but Big Yellow Taxi shows that simplicity can also be effective at creating impact.
