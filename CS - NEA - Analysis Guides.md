## Practice
- Keyboard Shortcut
	- For my program, I set my undo shortcut to Ctrl + Z as it is commonly used and transferable shortcut from other programs. If I had set it to another shortcut, the user may have to spend unnecessary time relearning a shortcut which could harm productivity.
- API Call
	- For my weather app, I used one weather API as it contained accurate data. I used it over another API as this one had less unnecessary data for my needs
- Programming Language
	- I chose python as my language due to it being a simpler program and being more comfortable. I used it over bash as it is a more universal language 
- Testing
	- I tested my program to ensure it works. I chose to test it as not testing it could impede the user's experience
