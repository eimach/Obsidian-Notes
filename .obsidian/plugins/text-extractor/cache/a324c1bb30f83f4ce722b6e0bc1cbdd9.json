A B P 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 A B Karnaugh maps Unit 8 Boolean algebra Simplifying an expression • Fill in the Karnaugh map for the expression: A ∨ (A ∧ B) Step 1: Divide the expression into the two parts on each side of the OR symbol (∨) The whole expression is true if A is true OR if (A AND B) is true 0 1 0 1 A B Karnaugh maps Unit 8 Boolean algebra Simplifying an expression • Fill in the Karnaugh map for the expression A ∨ (A ∧ B) Step 2: Write a 1 in each square for which A is true 0 1 0 1 1 1 A B Karnaugh maps Unit 8 Boolean algebra Simplifying an expression • Fill in the Karnaugh map for the expression A ∨ (A ∧ B) Step 3: Write a 1 in each square for which A ∧ B is true (The square, shown in red here, is already filled in, so nothing to do here) 0 1 0 1 1 1 A B Karnaugh maps Unit 8 Boolean algebra Simplifying an expression • Fill in the Karnaugh map for the expression A ∨ (A ∧ B) Step 4: Draw a box around the group of two adjacent 1s What expression is represented by the group? 0 1 0 1 1 1 A B Karnaugh maps Unit 8 Boolean algebra Simplifying an expression • Fill in the Karnaugh map for the expression A ∨ (A ∧ B) • The group outlined in green represents A • This is one of the Absorption rules • (A ∧ B) has been absorbed into the A group 0 1 0 1 1 1 A B Karnaugh maps Unit 8 Boolean algebra A 3-variable Karnaugh map • With three variables, we combine two of them across the columns • The terms 00, 01, 11, 10 are arranged so that in each subsequent term only one digit changes • Note carefully that they are NOT in numerical sequence 00 01 11 10 0 1 A BC Karnaugh maps Unit 8 Boolean algebra Example • Use a Karnaugh map to represent (A ∧ ¬ B) ∨ C Step 1: Put 1 in all squares in which (A ∧ ¬ B) is true 00 01 11 10 0 1 1 1 A BC Karnaugh maps Unit 8 Boolean algebra Example • Use a Karnaugh map to represent (A ∧ ¬ B) ∨ C Step 2: Put 1 in all squares in which C is true 00 01 11 10 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 A BC Karnaugh maps Unit 8 Boolean algebra A 3-variable Karnaugh map • The map represents (A ∧ ¬ B) ∨ C • We now group the items in groups of 1, 2, 4 or 8 (The groups can be overlapping) • Make each group as large as possible • Each 1 must be included in at least one group 00 01 11 10 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 A BC Karnaugh maps Unit 8 Boolean algebra A 3-variable Karnaugh map • The map represents (A ∧ ¬ B) ∨ C • The green group represents A ∧ ¬ B • The yellow group represents C • NOTE: Never make groups of 3, 5, 6 or 7! Only groups of 1, 2, 4 or 8 are allowed 00 01 11 10 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 A BC Karnaugh maps Unit 8 Boolean algebra Exercise • Fill in 1s to represent: (¬ A ∧ B ∧ C) ∨ (A ∧ ¬ B ∧ C) ∨ (A ∧ B ∧ ¬ C) ∨ (A ∧ B ∧ C) 00 01 11 10 0 1 A BC Karnaugh maps Unit 8 Boolean algebra Exercise – Step 1 • Fill in 1s to represent: (¬ A ∧ B ∧ C) ∨ (A ∧ ¬ B ∧ C) ∨ (A ∧ B ∧ ¬ C) ∨ (A ∧ B ∧ C) 00 01 11 10 0 1 1 A BC Karnaugh maps Unit 8 Boolean algebra Exercise – Step 2 • Fill in 1s to represent: (¬ A ∧ B ∧ C) ∨ (A ∧ ¬ B ∧ C) ∨ (A ∧ B ∧ ¬ C) ∨ (A ∧ B ∧ C) 00 01 11 10 0 1 1 1 A BC Karnaugh maps Unit 8 Boolean algebra Exercise – Step 3 • Fill in 1s to represent: (¬ A ∧ B ∧ C) ∨ (A ∧ ¬ B ∧ C) ∨ (A ∧ B ∧ ¬ C) ∨ (A ∧ B ∧ C) 00 01 11 10 0 1 1 1 1 A BC Karnaugh maps Unit 8 Boolean algebra Exercise – Step 4 • Fill in 1s to represent: (¬ A ∧ B ∧ C) ∨ (A ∧ ¬ B ∧ C) ∨ (A ∧ B ∧ ¬ C) ∨ (A ∧ B ∧ C) • Now group them in overlapping pairs • Remember to make each group as large as possible • How many groups do you end up with? 00 01 11 10 0 1 1 1 1 1 A BC Karnaugh maps Unit 8 Boolean algebra Exercise – Step 5 • The green group represents A ∧ C • The purple group represents A ∧ B • The yellow group represents B ∧ C • We have simplified the expression from: (¬ A ∧ B ∧ C) ∨ (A ∧ ¬ B ∧ C) ∨ (A ∧ B ∧ ¬ C) ∨ (A ∧ B ∧ C) to: (A ∧ C) ∨ (B ∧ C) ∨ (A ∧ B) 00 01 11 10 0 1 1 1 1 1 A BC Karnaugh maps Unit 8 Boolean algebra Worksheet 3 • Now try the questions in Task 1 Karnaugh maps Unit 8 Boolean algebra A 4-variable Karnaugh map • What does this map represent? 00 01 11 10 00 1 01 1 1 1 1 11 10 1 AB CD Karnaugh maps Unit 8 Boolean algebra A 4-variable Karnaugh map • What does this map represent? • Notice that the green group “wraps” but is still a single group 00 01 11 10 00 1 01 1 1 1 1 11 10 1 AB CD Karnaugh maps Unit 8 Boolean algebra A 4-variable Karnaugh map • This represents: (¬A ∧ B) ∨ (¬B ∧ ¬C ∧ ¬D) • Notice that the green group “wraps” but is still a single group 00 01 11 10 00 1 01 1 1 1 1 11 10 1 AB CD Karnaugh maps Unit 8 Boolean algebra Worksheet 3 • Now try the questions in Task 2 Karnaugh maps Unit 8 Boolean algebra Plenary • Karnaugh maps provide a method of simplifying expressions • This is often an easier method than using Boolean algebra (and more fun…) • You need to know both methods Copyright © 2016 PG Online Limited The contents of this unit are protected by copyright.
