He uses a text file called “Sales.txt” shown in Fig. 1. Each line represents the sales total for a different day of the week. The program can run at any point during the week and therefore the text file may not have seven lines. 2367.34 1986.92 2251.49 1882.40 2412.83 3411.32 2721.76 The program needs to read the text file and then calculate: . The number of days that the program is calculating over . The total sales over that period . The average daily sales over that period At the end of the text file, it should then print the results of these calculations to the screen. When the values are being read from the Sales.txt file they will be a string data type. In order for them to be processed they will need to be cast (i.e. converted) to a different data type. Explain what data type the values in “Sales.txt\" should be converted to.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
