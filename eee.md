# 1) What is the argument for making the Bank of England independent from the government? Or put differently, what might be the problems if the government decided the interest rate. As a follow up, do some research on how President Erdogan has intervened in monetary policy in recent years.

The BoE is independent as it prevents the ability for a country's monetary policy to be interfered due to political pressures (such as before an election). This allows for the central bank to be more willing and able to take necessary steps to protect the economy such as by reducing inflation, even if there may be certain negative consequences, such as unemployment, as the lack of political pressures is not present; the central bank's independence allows for its role to be transparent and accountable. If the government was in control of the interest rate, the problem of politics influencing the interest rate, and therefore the country's economy, rises as interest rates can be manipulated to further the government's interests and gain support from certain members of the economy as interest rates could be kept low which would stimulate growth in the short-term as the cost of borrowing would be cheap.

# 2) Why is it important for a central bank to reduce inflationary expectations as much as inflation itself?

A central bank which gains a reputation for effectively combating inflation helps to reduce inflationary expectations in the economy. This in turn, helps to reduce the likelihood of wage-price spirals. 
Inflationary expectations can influence future inflation as consumers and firms will change their spending habits and economic activity depending on what they think is likely to happen in the future. For example, if they expect prices to rise, consumption and investment will increase in the present, boosting AD and pushing prices and inflation up pre-emptively. Another example would be an expectation of higher inflation and workers, if workers anticipate higher inflation, they will demand higher wages, this can lead to firms raising prices to make-up the revenue that will be lost to wages or begin laying off workers which will lead to an increase in unemployment earlier than anticipated.

# 3) What is forward guidance and why has the Bank of England used it?

Forward Guidance is when the Central Bank announces to markets that it intends to keep interest rates at a certain level until a fixed point in the future. The aim of forward guidance is to influence long-term interest rates and market expectations. It is useful as it influences inflationary expectations.
