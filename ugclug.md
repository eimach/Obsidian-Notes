AO2: Application
How would a relational database be used, how will it scale and what tables would exist
How would a flat file database be used

AO3: Evaluation
Flat files are easier to set up and maintain with a small database so good for the present at 150. Gets slower as the database grows and will eventually have data redundancy and repetition
Relational is more futureproof and will be better for the database as it grows and gets to 10,000 as there 
Recommend which database to use and why

A database is an organised collection of data . A relational database is a database where the data is stored in multiple tables that are linked together using foreign keys. A flat file database is a database where all the data is stored in one table with records and fields.

For the leisure centre, a flat file database would have the fields such as  the member's name, their gym class bookings, appointments with instructors and maybe their date of birth. A relational database could have tables such as a gym class table which shows who has a booking with a certain class and an instructor table with the instructors and who has booked appointments with them and a member table. At 150 members, the flat file database would be good to use as it is easy to set up and maintain and doesn't require any special expertise but isn't futureproof. At 10,000 members, a relational database could be used to prevent the problem of data redundancy

A flat file database is good to use for the database when is small as it is easy to maintain but as the database grows larger, there will be a problem of data redundancy and it becoming slower to query the database and harder to maintain. However, a relational database is good to use as it scales well with the database's growth and won't have data redundancy due to the multiple tables that data is stored in and how they are linked together. Overall, a relational database is the better choice as they expect the leisure centre to grow to a large number and the scalability of it prevents the issues of flat file databases
