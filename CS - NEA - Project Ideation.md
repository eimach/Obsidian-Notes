- Music
- Racing, Cars

- Cybersecurity

# Potential Problems
- Music: 
	- Some Music Producers don't know music theory and find it difficult to learn it. 
	- Guitarists have chords they have figured out but don't know what type of chord it is or what the notes on the fretboard are
- Racing/Cars:
	- Can be difficult to visualise a bodykit for a car without having 3D modelling skills
	- Difficult to tune cars and know what each thing does in games like Assetto Corsa, BeamNG
- Games:
	- Not many racing games based on touge and with a retro feel 
	- Roguelike games can be difficult to understand
- Aerospace:
	- Lack of simple combat flight simulators that don't require specialised equipment (i.e HOTAS)
	- Learning the cockpit controls and systems is time-consuming and difficult for games like DCS or MSFS
- Cybersecurity:
	- Difficult for some people to know what emails are phishing emails or not
	- Some people want to know what ports on their network are open without having to use CLI tools

# Problem Solutions
- Barrier to Entry to Learning Music Theory:
	- Website/App that tracks progress and specialises their learning for them
- Chord Identification:
	- **Fretboard Analyser where users input the positions they fret and are given the notenames and chord**
- Visualising a Car Bodykit without 3D Modelling Knowledge:
	- Car Customisation Game that lets players pick and choose from a variety of different parts
- Car Tuning Assistant:
	- Suggests settings for the car and what to adjust according to what type of setup they want
- Lack of Retro Touge Racing Games:
	- **Retro-styled racing game 2D or 3D that has AI to race with or race against your ghost**
- Roguelike Games
	- **2D Top-Down roguelike game that adapts to player's skill and level and is simplified**
- Combat Flight Simulators have a Barrier to Entry of Equipment:
	- 3D Combat Flight Sim (DCS-like) that has a focus of keyboard and mouse controls, AI enemies and teammates
- Learning Cockpit Controls and Systems:
	- Interactive 3D Game? that guides players through tutorials for each system of the plane that players can pick and choose what to learn
- Difficult to Identify Phishing Emails:
	- Website that demonstrates real vs fake emails 

# 3D Retro Touge Racing Game

- Initial D Arcade Stage Zero
- Ridge Racer 7
- Gran Turismo 5
- Art of Rally
## Features I want to Implement
- General Racing Game Features: Time Attack Mode, Car Customisation, 
- IDAS Zero - Player Ghosts, Variety of Tracks, Arcade-style Driving Physics, AT/MT, Choice, Rival AI System, UI Inspiration, Controls
- Ridge Racer 7 - Music Selection, Brake to Drift, Camera Views
- Art of Rally - Rough Inspiration of Low Poly Graphics
## Libraries/Frameworks
- C#
- Unity Engine
## Algorithms
- An AI Pathing Algorithm to avoid player and track obstacles and boundaries, predictions?
- Vehicle Physics Algorithm
- Algorithm for UI elements changing mid-race (Speedometer, Lap Times)
- Algorithm for Ghost Car (Does player want to race ghost?, Show ghost on track)
- Algorithm for smooth Inputs
## Stakeholders
- Who? - Racing Game Enthusiasts, Gamers, Car/Racing Enthusiasts
- How to Contact? - Friends & Family, Social Media, Discussion Boards
- How to Collect Data? - In-Person Interview, Google Forms, Spreadsheet
